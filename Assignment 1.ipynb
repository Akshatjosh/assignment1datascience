    "Question 14- How is memory manage in python ?\n",
    "Answer 14- The Python memory manager uses a combination of reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory. Reference counting keeps track of the number of references to an object in memory, and when that count reaches zero, the memory occupied by the object is freed. Garbage collection is a process that periodically scans memory for objects that are no longer accessible by the program, and frees the memory occupied by those objects.\n",
    "The Python memory manager also makes use of a memory manager API, which provides a way for Python extensions and libraries to allocate memory in a way that is compatible with the memory manager. This allows extensions and libraries to be written in a way that works with the Python memory manager, and makes it easier to manage memory in Python programs.\n"
